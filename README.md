# A Collection of vim Configurations

Current modifications:

* map `jk` to <ESC>
* map mapleader to `" "`
* added spellcheck
* added onedark theme with polyglot
* added lightline and air-line

To use: clone as `.vim` in your home directory, symlink `.vimrc` to `.vim/vimrc` (i.e. `ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc`). 
This allows for easy clone and use on new boxes.
